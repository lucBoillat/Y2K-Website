# About
Website that mimicks the PS2 menu and the general Y2K aesthetic of the early 2000s.
three.js is used for the 3D objects. Runs on firefox, I may have forgotten browser-specific tags for certain browsers in the CSS.

# How to Run it
Clone and open index.html in a browser

# TODO
* Keyboard/Mouse/Gamepad support to navigate through the menu
* Different menus
  * Home -> 2 Choices, spinning spheres in background
  * Choice1 ->
  * Choice2 -> ps2 settings menu
* Get the aesthetic right, duh
